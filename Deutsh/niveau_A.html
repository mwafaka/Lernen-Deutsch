      <h2>German alphabet</h2>
      <p>
        German has often been viewed by non-Germans as a harsh sounding
        language. That may be due in part to the more guttural pronunciation of
        certain German alphabet sounds and diphthongs and perhaps even a still
        lingering effect of old WWII movie stereotypes. Once non-German speakers
        familiarize themselves with German’s different sounds however, another
        kind of poetic beauty will unfold before them that has been revered
        worldwide in the works of many German greats, such as Goethe, Schiller
        through prose and song.

      <h2>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GERMAN ALPHABET</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          More than 26 letters in the alphabet - German has a so called extended
          latin alphabet
        </li>
        <li>The extra letters are ä, ö, ü and ß</li>
        <li>
          The pronunciation of some of these letters do not exist in the English
          language Several letters are pronounced more from the back of the
          throat: g, ch, r (though in Austria the r is trilled)
        </li>
        .
        <li>The W in German sounds like the V in English</li>
        <li>The V in German sounds like the F in English</li>
        <li>
          Most of the time the S in German sounds like Z in English when placed
          at the beginning of a word followed by a vowel. The letter ß will
          never appear at the beginning of a word.
