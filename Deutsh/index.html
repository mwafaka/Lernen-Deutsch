      <h2>german language</h2>
      <p>
        German is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central
        Europe. It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in
        Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking
        Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the three
        official languages of Luxembourg. The languages which are most similar
        to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch:
        Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon,
        Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. German is the second most widely spoken
        Germanic language, after English.

      <h2>The History of German language</h2>
      <a href="http://www.germanlanguageguide.com/german/facts/history/"
        ><img src="img/history.png"
      /></a>
      <p>
        The history of the German language as separate from common West Germanic
        begins in the Early Middle Ages with the High German consonant shift.
        Old High German, Middle High German and Early New High German span the
        duration of the Holy Roman Empire. The 19th and 20th centuries saw the
        rise of Standard German and a decrease of dialectal variety. The 20th
        century brought around the German catastrophe. After World War I the use
        of German was suppressed and discouraged due to the anti-German
        sentiment, but nevertheless it did not inflict any lasting damage to its
        Sprachraum nor its lingua franca status in some areas . However, after
        World War II, territorial changes implemented by the Allies practically
        removed the German language from large parts of Central and Eastern
        Europe that were inhabited by German-speaking populations beginning in
        the 12th century. It contributed to moribundness and extinction of some
        local dialects like Silesian German, High Prussian or East Pomeranian
        dialects. Furthermore, it also damaged the language's status in
        Central-Western and Central-Southern Europe, where anti-German sentiment
        became even greater than before the war.

      <h2>Coat of arms of Germany</h2>

        href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Germany.svg"
        ><img src="img/ger.png"
      /></a>
      <p>
        The coat of arms of Germany displays a black eagle with a red beak,
        tongue and feet on a golden field, which is blazoned: Or, an eagle
        displayed sable beaked langued and membered gules. This is the
        Bundesadler (German for "Federal Eagle"), formerly known as the
        Reichsadler (German for "Imperial Eagle"). It is a re-introduction of
        the coat of arms of the Weimar Republic (in use 1919–1935), which was
        adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1950.[1] The current
        official design is due to Karl-Tobias Schwab (1887–1967) and was
        originally introduced in 1928. The German Empire of 1871–1918 had
        re-introduced the medieval coat of arms of the Holy Roman Emperors, in
        use during the 13th and 14th centuries (a black single-headed eagle on a
        golden background), before the emperors adopted the double-headed eagle,
        beginning with Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1433. The single-headed
        Prussian Eagle (on a white background; blazoned: Argent, an eagle
        displayed sable) was used as an escutcheon to represent the Prussian
        kings as dynasts of the German Empire. The Weimar Republic introduced a
        version in which the escutcheon and other monarchical symbols were
        removed.

      <p>
        The history of Germany is not the history of a nation, but of a race...
        Thus, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, it becomes the main
        trunk out of which branch histories of nearly all European nations,
        and... the connecting link between ancient and modern history. The
        records of no other race throw so much light upon the development of all
        civilized lands during a period of fifteen hundred years." So said
        Bayard Taylor in his book, History of Germany (p.3). Certainly, German
        contributions to civilization as we know it, have been massive. Great
        German philosophers, musicians, poets, inventors, historians - far too
        many to mention - have literally shaped this world's way of thinking
        over the centuries. Could the German Reich, the oldest political
        institution in Europe, which ruled the continent as the Holy Roman
        Empire for a thousand years, and which almost gained control of the
        WHOLE WORLD in two wars this century - could a people with a role in
        human affairs that large, be completely ignored in the Bible? That's
        what scholars would have you believe. The Bible does not mention the
        word "Germany" - and for good reason - they did not acquire that name
        until the Romans collectively labeled them Germani almost 2000 years
        ago. In fact, the Germans refer to themselves as Deutsch, not German.
        They call their beloved country Deutschland. If we are to find the
        German people mentioned in the Bible, it must be under some other name
        than what the Romans labeled them. For several years now, as regular
        readers of the Trumpet know, we have taught that modern-day Germany
        descended from the people the Bible refers to as the Assyrians. In this
        article, we will prove this fact from the Bible and other historical
        sources. Certainly, the Bible is the greatest historical source of all!
        In fact, IT IS THE ONLY COMPLETE HISTORICAL SOURCE WE HAVE concerning
        man's civilization. We have often said that one third of the Bible is
        prophecy, most of which is for our day. And you can be sure that Assyria
        is mentioned in numerous Bible prophecies. But much of the Bible is also
        history. It is in the Bible where we read of the beginning and
        establishment of the nation of Assyria - modern Germany. Together, Bible
        history and prophecy can give us the complete story of the German people
        from beginning to end. Let us now take a look at the early history of
        the German people.

      <h2>Flag of Germany</h2>
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Germany">
        <img src="img/flag.jpg" /><img=width:"30%"></a
      >
      <p>
        Germany has two competing traditions of national colours, black-red-gold
        and black-white-red, which have played an important role in the modern
        history of Germany. The black-red-gold tricolour's first appearance
        anywhere in a German-ethnicity sovereign state within what today
        comprises Germany occurred in 1778, and achieved prominence during the
        1848 Revolutions. The short-lived Frankfurt Parliament of 1848–1850
        proposed the tricolour as a flag for a united and democratic German
        state under a constitutional monarchy. With the formation of the
        short-lived Weimar Republic after World War I, the tricolour was adopted
        as the national flag of Germany. Sixteen years later following World War
        II, the tricolour was again designated as the flag of both West and East
        Germany divided states in 1949. The two flags were identical until 1959,
        when the East German flag was augmented with the coat of arms of East
        Germany. Since reunification on 3 October 1990, the black-red-gold
        tricolour has become the flag of a reunified Federal Republic of
        Germany. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the Prussian-dominated
        North German Confederation adopted a tricolour of black-white-red as its
        flag. This flag later became the flag of the German Empire, formed
        following the unification of Germany under the Prussian king who became
        emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 with the end of the First World
        War. Black, white, and red were reintroduced as the German national
        colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in
        1933, replacing German republican colours with imperial colours until
        the end of World War II. The colours of the modern flag are associated
        with the republican democracy first proposed in 1848, formed after World
        War I, and represent German unity and freedom.[3] During the Weimar
        Republic, the black-red-gold colours were the colours of the democratic,
        centrist, and republican political parties, as seen in the name of
        Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, formed by members of the Social
        Democratic, the Centre, and the Democratic parties to defend the
        republic against extremists on the right and left.
