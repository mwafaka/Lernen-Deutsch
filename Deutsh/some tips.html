      <h2>Find Your Big Why for Learning German</h2>
      <p>
        Even before you think about which materials to study, or your method for
        learning German , you need to take a step back and understand your
        underlying reason for wanting to speak German. This is your Big Why. My
        “Big Why” is an unquantifiable passion for languages. It isn’t something
        measurable like “So I can speak to X number of people in the world”, but
        it has to do with enriching my life with friendships and experiences,
        which you can’t really measure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some reasons for learning German that could be your Big Why:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>To have conversations with German speaking family members</li>
        <li>
          To find a job in a German company (Germany is one of the biggest
          economies in the world)
        </li>
        <li>To speak with natives as you travel in the heart of Europe</li>
        <li>
          To read the classics of German literature (think Johann Wolfgang von
          Goethe, Herman Hesse and Franz Kafka)
        </li>
        <li>To get an inside view of German culture</li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          You don’t need to live in Germany to immerse yourself in the German
          language. There are many ways to plunge yourself headfirst into German
          wherever you live. Here are a few of my top ways to bring Germany to
          your hometown:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make Your Computer Multilingual. Why not turn your computer into a
            German-only system?
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the German Speakers in Your City. Believe it or not, there are
            many communities of German speakers around the world. You may be
            near one and not even realize it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch German Television and Movies. Force yourself to focus by
            watching without subtitles.

        <h2>Use Language Hacks to Learn German Fast</h2>

        <p>
          Language hacks are shortcuts that help you learn a language faster.
          Here are a few of my favourite language hacks that can help you learn
          German fast:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS). SRS is a great method for
            memorizing vocabulary and phrases. It is probably the most effective
            hack you can use to pick up new vocabulary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Mnemonics. Mnemonics help you create associations to easily
            recall German words. The key to mnemonics? Use your imagination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus Your Study with the Pomodoro Technique. This technique allows
            you to break up your study sessions into smaller chunks of time
            resulting in better focus and a more effective learning experience.

          Use Conversational Connectors – How Beginners Can Get their Flow
        </h2>
        <img src="img/tips4.jpg" height="30%" width="30%" />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Like most languages, German uses a set of call and response phrases
            that I call conversational connectors. These are crucial to everyday
            conversations, but they aren’t usually found in phrasebooks.
          </li>
          <li>
            When my friend Anthony Lauder introduced me to conversational
            connectors a few years ago, they blew my mind. They’re a great
            technique for sounding more like a native speaker, for removing the
            awkwardness from conversations, and for giving yourself time to
            recall vocabularly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here’s an example of how they work. When someone asks you “How is
            your hotel room?” instead of answering with “um … good” , which
            pretty much ends things right on the spot, you might add in phrases
            and expressions to create a more organic feel to what you are
            saying. You could say: “To tell the truth, that is a good question.
            The hotel room is good. Thanks for asking. How is your hotel room?”
            . This is exactly the same answer with conversational connectors
            added in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conversational connectors are extremely helpful because you can use
            them in a variety of situations such as agreeing with someone,
            sharing your opinion, or changing the subject.
